  <p style="color: #222222 !important;">Welcome to GraphBot, an AI-powered graph generation tool. This website is designed to help you quickly and easily create aesthetic visualisations of your data. With an easy-to-use interface, you can create and download visualisations of your data through simple requests in plain English terms. Our application will then process your request and create a downloadable graph.</p>
  <p style="color: #222222 !important;">To ensure your data remains secure, our machine-learning model is integrated into the website, meaning your data remains under your control at all times, never being sent away to unknown external parties.</p>

  <h2>How to use the tool</h2>
  <ol>
      <li><strong>Upload your data:</strong> Make sure you upload your data file to the website in the correct format for the creation of your graph.</li>
      <li><strong>Enter your query:</strong> Explain how you want your data to be graphed in the search bar, including the variables used for the x and y axes, as well as what type of graph should be created. See below for example requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Generate your graph:</strong> Click the send button to analyse your request and create a graph of your data. You can download your new graph by clicking the button below the new image.</li>
      <li><strong>What next:</strong> Congratulations! You have successfully created a plot of your data using natural language. You can now close the browser which will delete all cached information about your datafile. If desired, you can enter a new request to produce a different visualisation of your data or upload a new file to create a graph of different data.</li>
